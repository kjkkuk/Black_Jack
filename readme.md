## Need to implement BlackJack Console game using ruby.

### Plan:
1. On game start we should ask user to provide his name and store it

2. Then ask to press any key to start the game

3. User and computer get 2 cards each

4. System asks user if he wants to take one more card (cycle)

5. WHen user stop taking new cards and his score <= 21, computer logic takes cards one by one (max is determined by CONSTANT)

6. Showing results and asking user about new game.
